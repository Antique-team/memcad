MemCAD release HOWTO
====================

This HOWTO describes how to release a new version of MemCAD as an official
OPAM[0] package.

I - Tag a new release
---------------------

First, make sure the source tree doesn't contain things you don't want to
release to the public (files in bench/, git commit logs, etc.).

Please follow the semantic versioning scheme[1] when creating a version number.
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

The official website for the source code of memcad is:
https://github.com/Antique-team/memcad

You must tag this new version of the software:
---
git tag v1.0.1 # for example
git push --tags git@github.com:Antique-team/memcad.git
---

Github will automatically create a tarball for this version at:
https://github.com/Antique-team/memcad/archive/v1.0.1.tar.gz

II - Create a new OPAM package
------------------------------

Now, you must create a new OPAM package.
For simplicity, we will reuse the already existing package.

---
git clone https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository.git
cd opam-repository
cp -a packages/memcad/memcad.1.0.0 packages/memcad/memcad.1.0.1
---

Update the URL and MD5 of your new tarball in file
packages/memcad/memcad.1.0.1/url.

Store the new package version in a specific git branch:
---
git checkout -b memcad_1.0.1
git add packages/memcad/memcad.1.0.1
git commit packages/memcad/memcad.1.0.1
---

Then create a pull request with your branch at:
https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository

Once your pull request is accepted, the new package will be available
to all opam users within a few days (and after they execute 'opam update').
